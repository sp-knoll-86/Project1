OVERALL IDEA - cost mileage estimator
Go for usability and functionality over something fun
Geocoding app potentially 

App to track cost to drive from point A to point B (like how Uber does) 

	1. CarQuery API (pulls car make/model information)
	2. Bing Maps API 
	3. GasBuddy


Waze
Uber or Lyft trip/cost estimators?
MyGasFeed API (pulls gas pricing data based on map)
RepairPal (avg repair cost)

Opening interface -- what user will see
	* Will see map (Bing Maps for example)
	* Form to enter Year, Make, Model and Trim of vehicle
	* Form specify Point A to Point B
	* Gas price populates on screen
	* Point A to Point B -- frequency tracker (calculate five times, for example)



Miscellaneous notes from Byron 

Compare your trip with uber/lyft trip cost 
--Annual cost estimator for using personal car or ride sharing throughout the year?
-- are there toll roads? Avoid tolls? 

Look at autoist app?

compare personal mileage cost vs using riding sharing service

***Tasks we need to focus on first before advancing any further
MVP
	* Have an interactive map (Bing Maps)
    * GPS/directions functionality
	* Have car data available (carquery API)
	* Regional average for gas prices (GasBuddy)
	* User input field for Point A to Point B
	* Display would show cost for trip



UI/Design
	* Mobile first
	* Header / footer
	* Drop down menu for forms
	* Area for trip cost (like a modal)
	* Map is the hero -- will take up most real estate

After Saturday homework is completed, start to research targeted APIs.
